            <h2>Bionano Genomics User Group Meeting</h2>
                <p>
                        In October 2018, I had the opportunity to visit Bionano Genomics&apos;s campus in LaJolla.
                        <article id="BNG">
                                Briefly, Bionano is an optical mapping technique that labels super long molecules of DNA at 
                                restriction labeling motifs, passes the molecules through nano channels to linearize them, 
                                and then takes pictures to visualize the patterns of labels on each molecule.  
                                The pictures of these molecules can be assembled like a puzzle, producing bionano genomic (BNG) maps 
                                that often approach chromosome-arm length.  The patterns of the BNG maps can be aligned to the patterns 
                                genomic sequence to construct ultra-long scaffolds, giving sequences context.  BNG maps can also be aligned 
                                to either BNG maps from other genomes or a reference genome sequence assembly to identify structural variation.

                        <p>The meeting was filled with exciting talks by brilliant, passionate scientists. I&apos;m so thrilled that I got to go.</p>

                <p>
                        After the meeting, I bummed around the Gaslamp District.  I found a place to get a drink that had been recommended 
                        by a friend who is much cooler than I am and thus not at all my speed &mdash; very young, there was a gong and yelling and 
                        shot specials at 3pm, but the cherry cider was nice, and I liked how happy everyone else seemed to be there. That night 
                        I ate cheeseburgers and stayed in an old camper someone had converted into a chic (and cheap) airbnb.  It was cute and quirky 
                        and the bed sloped precipitously.

            <h2>Palm Desert</h2>

                        <br>ÃŸ
                        The next day, I rented a car and drove over the mountains and through the San Bernardino National Forest to 
                        Palm Desert, where I&apos;d stay with new friends, who were funny and liberal and (she was) fierce and (he was) sweet, 
                        comsummate So-Cal business people, and talk late into the night about politics and sit in their backyard at the base 
                        of &quot;their mountain&quot; and watch the hikers wend their way to the summit early in the morning as we drank <a href="https://www.saveur.com/california-date-shake-shields" target="_blank">
                        date shakes</a> for breakfast.

            <h2>Salton Sea</h2>
                <p>
                        I drove to the Salton Sea on my way back to the coast on their recommendation, which is a weird place, quiet and nearly 
                        abandoned and ringed with trailer parks and a few schools eerily empty in the middle of the week.  I tried to make it down to 
                        the water which smelled foul and brackish and the salt sparkled in the white sand, and the sun-bleached fish bones, millions 
                        of them, crunched strangely under my feet, but I stepped in deep fish gut mud and had to turn back.

        <div id="Oceanside" class="section">
            <h2>Oceanside</h2>
                <p>
                        I drove back over the mountains, which seemed much less nerve-wracking than the descent into Palm Springs, and to Oceanside, 
                        where I met another friend, gorgeous and kind and calm. We walked up and down the beach barefoot and watched little kids build 
                        sandcastles and the sandpipers running from the waves on their hilarious twiggy legs.  The water was cold.  I put my toes in.  
                        I&apos;d never seen that ocean before, and I stayed on the beach until the sun set over the water.

                        <p>
                        We got a beer at a place that felt hipster, but in a patchouli and dim lighting and kitchy comfortable sort of way.

                <p>
                        The next day was my flight home, but I went back to the beach first and waded into the water up to my ribs and felt the pull of the surf 
                        and stayed there until my skin was numb from cold and my midwestern gut began to worry about sharks.  The way the air felt on my skin, the constant
                        breeze, and the palm trees,
                        and the casual abundance of avocados, just cocky amounts of perfect avocados at every meal, and the way I could, in a day, see mountains and lakes and oceans and desert, 
                        and the immensity of it, the immensity of the ocean and the desert, and all the gorgeous, kind, and calm friends I spent time with. 
                        I loved every minute of that vacation.
